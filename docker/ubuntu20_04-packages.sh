# This is a work in progress, and will doubtless change as deficiencies are
# identified.  For now, preserve all the CentOS 7 semantics we can.  The notion
# of package categories being "runtime", "development", "source_env", and "extra"
# is potentially useful on non-CentOS systems.  *ubuntu distros customarily have
# at least one "extras" repo (partner) that is not enabled by default.  Note that
# "bash" is required: "/bin/sh" points to "dash" on *ubuntu 20.04 LTS systems.

# Install or list required and available packages for *ubuntu 20.04 LTS
#
# The packages are really in four categories (and in 4 variables PKGS_{R,D,S,E})
# R. Simply required packages for runtime
#    -- note the driver package has separate requirements for driver rebuilding etc.
# D. Simply required packages for devel
# S. Convenience packages, normally not required by either of the above categories
#    -- Generally useful in a source installation, like rpmbuild, etc.
# E. Packages from other repos that are enabled as category 'D' (e.g. use epel)
#    -- assumed needed for devel
#    -- thus they are installed after category 'D' is installed

# Add 32-bit cross-architecture packages as required: *ubuntu has multi-arch support

# Comments around/within the next two functions are for my own
# edification.  The original Bourne shell had no support for
# arrays other than positional parameters (assigned with "set")
# and having the restrictions of (a) not being able to directly
# access any parameters beyond the 9th; and (b) having to use
# "shift" to get to the parameters beyond the 9th.  Likewise,
# there were no convenient built-in methods of performing string
# operations (matching, substring extraction, substitution, etc.).
# For our purposes, ASSuming "/bin/sh" is "bash" or compatible
# with "bash" is probably safe: one source claims we left the
# dark ages behind when Solaris 11 was released, at which time
# "/bin/sh" became POSIX sh.
